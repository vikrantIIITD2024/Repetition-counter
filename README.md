# Repetition-counter
It was a period of lockdown, and we were all prohibited from leaving our homes. I used to do certain exercises, and every time I did some exercises, I neglected to count the repetitions. As a result, I decided to write a programme in OpenCV to keep track of my repeats so that I could do it more efficiently.
Code is yet to be Uploaded.
